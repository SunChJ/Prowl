# 059 — Agent Transcript Snapshots: Action Log

## Timeline

| Date | Change | Ref |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-11 | Wrote the snapshot-first plan and established the CLI/result-state contract. | This entry |
| 2026-08-11 | Added `prowl agents read` for explicit Codex/Claude panes, live blocker extraction, fresh transcript attribution, bounded decoders, contracts, and user guidance. | Pending PR |

## Outcome & current state (as of 2026-08-11)

- `ProwlCLI/Commands/AgentsCommand.swift` and
  `ProwlCLI/Commands/AgentsReadCommand.swift` expose `prowl agents read <pN|uuid>`
  with immediate-only targeting, a 1–4 MiB result cap, and text-only `--result-only`.
- `supacode/CLIService/AgentReadCommandHandler.swift` keeps live snapshot evidence
  independent from transcript result evidence. It returns `complete`, `pending`,
  `unavailable`, `missing`, `incomplete`, or `too_large` in `AgentReadResult`; only
  `--result-only` turns non-complete states into command errors.
- `supacode/App/supacodeApp.swift` performs an on-demand active-screen detection pass,
  re-identifies the foreground process, and calls the fresh resolver path. It permits
  only exact/high transcript-backed Codex/Claude sessions.
- `supacode/Infrastructure/AgentDetection/AgentTranscriptResultReader.swift` reads a
  bounded, stable JSONL tail with one mutation retry; it decodes closed Codex
  `task_complete` and Claude `turn_duration` parent-chain results without returning
  partial text. `AgentSessionResolver.resolveFresh` bypasses only the pid-result cache.
- `ClaudeScreenProfile` and `CodexScreenProfile` now export the raw blocked interaction
  region used by the command. `ProwlCLI/Output/OutputRenderer.swift` renders the normal
  status snapshot or writes result-only bytes directly without a synthetic newline.
- Shared models, routing, 32 MiB socket-frame guards, normative contracts, the user CLI
  guide, and the bundled `prowl-cli` skill were updated together.

## Verification

| Command | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| `make check` | Passed: changed-file formatting, strict swift-format lint, and SwiftLint. |
| `make test` | Passed: xcresult reported 2,313 tests with zero failures. |
| `make build-cli` | Passed. |
| `make test-cli-smoke` | Passed. |
| `make test-cli-integration` | Passed: 68 tests. |
| `make build-app` | Passed: Debug macOS app build with zero warnings. |

## Deviations from plan

- The decoder tests use compact synthetic JSONL records in
  `supacodeTests/AgentTranscriptResultReaderTests.swift` instead of committing captured
  transcript fixture files. They cover the observed Codex 0.146.1 and Claude Code
  2.1.226 completion shapes without recording user transcript content.

## Open questions

- Native transcript schemas are intentionally narrow. A future Codex or Claude Code
  release that changes its completion markers must add a captured/redacted regression
  case before broadening the decoder.
